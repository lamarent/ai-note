# ADR 1: Technology Stack Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2023-08-21

## Context

We need to select a technology stack for the AI Brainstorm application that enables rapid development, good developer experience, and optimal performance. The stack should support AI integration and provide a solid foundation for future growth.

## Decision Drivers

- Development speed and efficiency
- Type safety and code quality
- Performance and scalability
- Cost considerations
- Team familiarity
- Ecosystem maturity
- Support for AI integration

## Options Considered

### Frontend

1. **React with Vite**

   - Pros: Fast development, good DX, mature ecosystem
   - Cons: Requires additional libraries for state, styling, etc.

2. **Next.js**

   - Pros: Built-in SSR/SSG, routing, API routes
   - Cons: More opinionated, potentially less flexible for our use case

3. **SvelteKit**
   - Pros: Less boilerplate, compiled approach, built-in features
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less team familiarity

### Backend

1. **Cloudflare Workers with Hono**

   - Pros: Edge computing, great performance, serverless, low cost
   - Cons: Some limitations in the serverless environment

2. **Node.js with Express**

   - Pros: Familiar, massive ecosystem, flexible
   - Cons: Requires more infrastructure management, potentially higher costs

3. **Fastify or NestJS**
   - Pros: Performance-focused, structured, TypeScript support
   - Cons: Learning curve, more complex setup

### Database

1. **PostgreSQL with Prisma**

   - Pros: Strongly typed queries, schema migrations, ACID compliance
   - Cons: Prisma adds an abstraction layer

2. **Supabase or Firebase**

   - Pros: Real-time capabilities, managed service
   - Cons: Less control, potential lock-in

3. **MongoDB**
   - Pros: Flexible schema, JSON-like documents
   - Cons: Less type safety without additional tools

## Decision

We have decided to use:

- **Frontend**: React with Vite, using DaisyUI (Tailwind), Zustand, React Query, and React Hook Form
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers with Hono framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API

## Rationale

- **React + Vite**: Provides the best balance of development speed, ecosystem support, and flexibility. Vite's fast HMR enhances developer experience.
- **Cloudflare Workers + Hono**: Offers excellent performance, global distribution, and cost-effective scaling. Hono provides TypeScript support and a modern API design.
- **PostgreSQL + Prisma**: Ensures type safety, data integrity, and schema evolution. Prisma simplifies database access with its type-safe query builder.
- **DaisyUI + Tailwind**: Accelerates UI development with pre-built components while maintaining customization options.
- **Zustand + React Query**: Provides simple but powerful state management and data fetching capabilities with minimal boilerplate.

This stack maximizes developer productivity while maintaining performance and type safety throughout the application.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Enhanced developer experience with modern tooling
- Strong type safety across the entire stack
- Reduced operational costs with serverless backend
- Excellent performance with edge computing
- Reduced boilerplate code with selected libraries
- Good foundation for AI feature integration

### Negative

- Some learning curve for team members unfamiliar with specific tools
- Potential limitations in Cloudflare Workers environment
- Dependency on third-party services (Cloudflare, OpenAI)
- Requires careful management of OpenAI API costs

### Neutral

- Will need to implement authentication separately (no built-in solution)
- May need additional tooling for monitoring and observability
