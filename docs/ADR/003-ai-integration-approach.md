# ADR 3: AI Integration Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Date

## Context

The AI Brainstorm application requires integration with AI capabilities to generate, expand, and refine ideas. We need to determine the most effective approach for this integration, balancing functionality, cost, complexity, and user experience.

## Decision Drivers

- Quality of AI-generated content
- Cost of AI API usage
- Integration complexity
- Response time
- Scalability
- Flexibility for different brainstorming techniques
- Control over prompt engineering

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Direct OpenAI API Integration

Integrate directly with the OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/GPT-4) from our backend services.

Pros:

- High-quality AI responses
- Full control over prompt engineering
- Flexibility to customize for different use cases
- Latest model capabilities

Cons:

- Can be expensive at scale
- Requires careful API key management
- Potential for high latency
- Dependency on a single provider

### Option 2: Multiple AI Provider Integration

Integrate with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.) with an abstraction layer.

Pros:

- Provider redundancy
- Ability to choose models based on cost/performance
- Potential cost optimization

Cons:

- Increased complexity
- Inconsistent results across providers
- More complex prompt management

### Option 3: Self-hosted Open Source Models

Deploy and run open-source models (like Llama 2) on our own infrastructure.

Pros:

- Full control over the infrastructure
- No per-request costs
- Data privacy

Cons:

- Significant infrastructure requirements
- Higher operational complexity
- Potentially lower quality than commercial APIs
- Development and maintenance overhead

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach

Use pre-computed templates and patterns with selective AI augmentation.

Pros:

- Reduced dependency on AI for every request
- Lower overall costs
- More predictable response times

Cons:

- Limited novelty in some responses
- More development work for templates
- Complex decision logic for when to use AI

## Decision

We have decided to implement Option 1: Direct OpenAI API Integration for the MVP, with architectural provisions to move toward Option 2 or Option 4 in the future.

The implementation will include:

1. A dedicated AI service module in the backend to encapsulate all AI-related functionality
2. Carefully crafted prompts for different brainstorming scenarios
3. Caching mechanisms to reduce redundant API calls
4. Rate limiting to prevent excessive costs
5. Monitoring of API usage and costs

For the API integration, we will:

1. Use OpenAI's Chat Completion API with the GPT-3.5-turbo model as the default
2. Implement system prompts that prime the AI for brainstorming activities
3. Allow users to select from different brainstorming techniques (e.g., SCAMPER, lateral thinking)
4. Store successful prompts and their contexts for iterative improvement

## Rationale

We chose Option 1 for the MVP for the following reasons:

1. **Fastest Path to MVP**: Direct integration with OpenAI API allows us to quickly implement AI features without building complex infrastructure.

2. **Quality of Results**: OpenAI's models offer high-quality outputs suitable for creative brainstorming.

3. **Flexibility**: The OpenAI API provides sufficient flexibility to implement various brainstorming techniques through careful prompt design.

4. **Cost Management**: For the MVP phase, we can implement caching and rate limiting to manage costs effectively, and the expected usage volume is within reasonable cost parameters.

5. **Future Extensibility**: The encapsulated AI service design allows us to swap out providers or implement a hybrid approach in the future without significant refactoring.

The architectural design will maintain abstractions that allow us to evolve the system toward Option 2 or Option 4 as the user base grows and usage patterns become clearer.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Rapid implementation of high-quality AI features
- Flexibility in prompt engineering
- Good user experience with fast, relevant idea generation
- Clean abstraction for future provider changes

### Negative

- Direct dependency on OpenAI's service reliability
- Potential for unexpected costs if usage spikes
- Need for careful monitoring and rate limiting

### Neutral

- Will require ongoing prompt optimization
- May need to implement more sophisticated caching as usage grows
- Future migration to multiple providers will require additional effort

## Implementation Details

### AI Service Interface

```typescript
interface AIService {
  generateIdeas(prompt: string, options: GenerationOptions): Promise<string[]>;
  expandIdea(idea: string, options: ExpansionOptions): Promise<string[]>;
  categorizeIdeas(ideas: string[]): Promise<Record<string, string[]>>;
  refineIdea(idea: string, instructions: string): Promise<string>;
}
```

### Prompt Templates

We will create and maintain a library of prompt templates for different brainstorming techniques:

```typescript
const promptTemplates = {
  general: `Generate creative and diverse ideas related to: {{topic}}`,
  scamper: `Using the SCAMPER technique (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse), generate ideas for: {{topic}}`,
  lateralThinking: `Using lateral thinking techniques, generate unusual and innovative ideas for: {{topic}}`,
  // More techniques to be added
};
```

### Cost Control Measures

1. Implement response caching for identical prompts
2. Limit the number of AI requests per session
3. Set maximum tokens for API calls
4. Implement user quotas in future versions
