# 003 - UI Enhancements for Session & Ideas Pages

This document outlines a plan to improve the layout, readability, and user experience of the session detail and ideas list pages.

## Goals

- Improve overall page structure and component organization
- Enhance visual hierarchy and spacing
- Separate concerns into focused subcomponents
- Standardize card and form styling
- Improve responsive design and accessibility

## Tasks

### 1. Refactor SessionDetailPage

- Extract `SessionHeader` component for title and action buttons
- Extract `SessionMetadata` component to display description, status, and dates
- Introduce a top toolbar or tab navigation placeholder for switching between "Ideas" and upcoming features (AI Suggestions)
- Ensure loading and error states use consistent card styles

### 2. Refactor IdeasList

- Extract `IdeaForm` component for creating and editing ideas
- Create `IdeaItem` component to render each idea with edit/delete actions
- Replace native `window.confirm` with custom `Modal` for delete confirmation
- Add a header to the list showing idea count and optional filter or sort controls
- Switch from vertical stack to a responsive grid or masonry layout for idea cards

### 3. Styling and Responsiveness

- Apply consistent margin, padding, and typography across subcomponents
- Use DaisyUI and Tailwind utility classes for dark/light mode compatibility
- Test layout on mobile breakpoints and adjust flex/grid behavior

### 4. Accessibility and UX

- Add `aria-label` attributes to icons and buttons
- Ensure keyboard focus states on form inputs and buttons
- Provide clear feedback on validation errors and loading states

## Timeline

- **Day 1:** Refactor `SessionDetailPage` into subcomponents
- **Day 2:** Refactor `IdeasList` with extracted subcomponents
- **Day 3:** Apply styling, responsiveness adjustments, accessibility checks
