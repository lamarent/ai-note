# AI Brainstorm App Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the AI Brainstorm application, including its components, data flow, and technical decisions.

## High-Level Architecture

The AI Brainstorm app follows a modern web application architecture with separate frontend and backend services, using a monorepo approach for better code sharing and management.

## Component Breakdown

### Frontend (React + Vite)

- **UI Layer**: React components using DaisyUI and TailwindCSS for styling
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **API Communication**: React Query for data fetching and caching
- **Forms**: React Hook Form for form handling and validation

### Backend (Cloudflare Workers + Hono)

- **API Layer**: Hono for routing and request handling
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Business Logic**: Service modules handling core functionality
- **AI Integration**: Service for communicating with AI providers

### Database (PostgreSQL + Prisma)

- Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- PostgreSQL for reliable data storage
- Schema designed for brainstorming sessions and ideas

### AI Service Integration

- Integration with OpenAI API or alternative
- Prompt engineering for idea generation
- Rate limiting and caching for cost optimization

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the frontend UI
2. Frontend makes API calls to the backend
3. Backend validates requests and processes them
4. If AI generation is needed, backend calls the AI service
5. Results are persisted in the database if necessary
6. Response is sent back to the frontend
7. Frontend updates UI with the results

## Security Architecture

- CORS protection for API endpoints
- Input validation on both client and server
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Monorepo Structure

```
/
|-- apps/
|   |-- web/             # React Frontend
|   `-- worker/          # Cloudflare Worker Backend
|-- packages/
|   |-- ui/              # Shared UI components
|   |-- types/           # Shared TypeScript types
|   `-- config/          # Shared configurations
|-- docs/                # Project documentation
`-- scripts/             # Utility scripts
```

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Using Cloudflare Workers**: Provides edge computing capabilities, reducing latency and improving reliability.
2. **React with Vite**: Offers fast development experience and optimal production builds.
3. **Prisma ORM**: Provides type safety and reduces database access complexity.
4. **AI Service Integration**: External API for idea generation to avoid building ML infrastructure.
5. **Monorepo Structure**: Facilitates code sharing and ensures consistency across packages.

## Scaling Considerations

- Cloudflare Workers scale automatically
- Database could be upgraded to a managed PostgreSQL service for production
- AI service calls can be optimized with caching and batching
- Frontend assets can be served via CDN for improved performance

## Development Environment

Local development will use:

- PNPM for package management
- Local PostgreSQL database (or containerized)
- Mock AI service for development without API costs
- Hot reloading for improved developer experience
