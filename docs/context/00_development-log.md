# Development Log

This file tracks the development activities of the AI Brainstorm app in reverse chronological order (newest entries at the top).

## 2025-05-01: AI Service Implementation

- **Implemented AI service integration:**
  - Created `AIService` class in `packages/backend/src/services/ai.ts` to interface with OpenAI
  - Implemented four core AI features:
    - `generateIdeas`: Generate new ideas based on a prompt
    - `expandIdea`: Create related ideas branching from an existing idea
    - `getAlternativePerspectives`: See an idea from different viewpoints
    - `refineIdea`: Improve existing ideas based on instructions
  - Added support for different brainstorming techniques (General, SCAMPER, Lateral Thinking, Six Thinking Hats, 5W1H)
- **Created AI routes in backend:**

  - Added `packages/backend/src/routes/ai.ts` with endpoints:
    - `POST /api/ai/generate`: Generate ideas from prompts
    - `POST /api/ai/expand`: Expand existing ideas
    - `POST /api/ai/perspectives`: Get alternative perspectives
    - `POST /api/ai/refine`: Refine ideas based on instructions
  - Integrated AI routes with IdeaRepository to save AI-generated ideas
  - Added proper error handling and type validation

- **Environment configuration:**

  - Updated `wrangler.toml` with AI service configuration
  - Updated environment type definitions in `index.ts`
  - Added proper environment variables for AI API key, URL, and model

- **Technical details:**

  - Used OpenAI Chat Completions API with structured JSON response format
  - Implemented proper error handling for API failures
  - Added fallback responses for parsing errors
  - Ensured all AI-generated ideas are properly typed and compatible with database schemas

- **Next steps:**

## 2025-XX-XX: Documentation & Context Restructuring

- **Goal:** Restructure `docs` and `docs/context` for clarity and improved AI usability.
- **Actions:**
  - Created `docs/planning/001-docs-restructure-plan.md` detailing the plan.
  - Merged `MVP-Plan.md` and `Features.md` into `docs/Product-Specification.md`.
  - Created `docs/guides/` directory and moved relevant guides (`database.md`, `cloudflare-d1-migration.md`) into it.
  - Restructured `docs/context/`:
    - Renamed `development-log.md` to `00_development-log.md`.
    - Created `knowledge-base/`, `state/`, `references/` directories.
    - Merged specific context notes (e.g., database details) into `knowledge-base/`.
    - Updated `docs/context/README.md` to reflect the new structure and usage.
  - Deleted redundant files and the `docs/context/archive/` directory.
  - Updated links in `docs/README.md`.
  - Created `docs/guides/AI-Assistant-Workflow.md` to guide AI interactions with the new structure.
  - Added link to the new AI guide in `docs/README.md`.
- **Outcome:** Documentation is now more organized. The context system emphasizes `00_development-log.md` for chronology and `knowledge-base/` for persistent, topic-specific knowledge.
- **Next Steps:** Utilize the new structure for ongoing development logging and context tracking.

## 2024-10-11: DaisyUI Refactoring

- **Refactored frontend components to use DaisyUI:**
  - Removed custom Tailwind CSS styles from common components (`Button`, `Card`, `Modal`, `Input`), layout components (`Header`, `Footer`, `Layout`), idea components (`AddIdeaForm`, `IdeaCard`, `IdeaForm`, `IdeasList`), and session components (`SessionDetail`, `SessionsList`, `EnhancedSessionPage`).
  - Replaced custom styles with DaisyUI component classes (`btn`, `card`, `modal`, `navbar`, `footer`, `alert`, `loading`, `badge`, `form-control`, `input`, `textarea`, `select`, `join`, etc.) and semantic theme colors (`primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `neutral`, `base-100/200/300`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`).
  - Ensured components utilize `base-*` colors for backgrounds and content to support light/dark themes automatically.
  - Updated `EnhancedSessionPage` extensively, moving inline forms to modals and using DaisyUI structure throughout.
- **Error Resolution:**
  - Fixed numerous type errors arising from inconsistent type definitions (`Session`, `Idea`, `Category`) across different API/type files by standardizing usage within components (though underlying type inconsistencies in hooks/API might remain).
  - Corrected hook import paths and usage based on definitions (`useGetSession`, `useGetSessionIdeas`, etc.).
  - Resolved issues with mutation payloads to match expected types.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Thoroughly test the UI in both light and dark modes.
  - Address the underlying type inconsistencies between `api/types.ts` and `api/*Api.ts` definitions and update hooks accordingly for better type safety.

## 2024-10-11: Hooks and Component Refactoring (Continued)

- **Refactored Core Data Hooks:**
  - Standardized `useSessions.ts`, `useIdeas.ts`, and `useCategories.ts`.
  - Imported specific types (`Session`, `Idea`, `Category`, `Create*Data`, `Update*Data`) directly from their respective `api/*Api.ts` files.
  - Replaced raw `fetch` calls with methods from the corresponding API service modules (`sessionApi`, `ideaApi`, `categoryApi`).
  - Ensured proper error handling (throwing `Error` on failed API responses).
  - Implemented robust query key structures (`SESSION_KEYS`, `IDEA_KEYS`, `CATEGORY_KEYS`) for granular cache management.
  - Added appropriate cache invalidation logic (`queryClient.invalidateQueries`, `queryClient.setQueryData`, `queryClient.removeQueries`) in mutation `onSuccess` handlers to keep UI consistent, including invalidating related queries (e.g., invalidating idea lists when a category is deleted/updated).
- **Updated `EnhancedSessionPage.tsx`:**
  - Adjusted component to consume the refactored hooks and their standardized return types.
  - Imported types directly from `api/*Api.ts` files.
  - Corrected property access (e.g., `session.title`, `idea.categoryId`, `category.color`, `category.sessionId`) in JSX and event handlers.
  - Updated form state management (`useState`) to use `Partial<Create*Data>` and `Partial<Update*Data>` types.
  - Ensured data payloads passed to mutation hooks match the required `Create*Data` and `Update*Data` types.
  - Re-enabled category filtering based on `category.sessionId` and category display/selection features.
- **Redundancy Note:** The file `packages/frontend/src/api/types.ts` likely contains outdated or less specific types and may be redundant now that hooks/components use types directly from `api/*Api.ts`. Consider removing or refactoring this file.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Implement core features, starting with drag-and-drop for ideas.
  - Run linters (`pnpm -r lint`) to catch any remaining issues.
  - Address the potential redundancy of `api/types.ts`.

## 2024-10-12: UI & API Refactoring

- **Integrated Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI:**
  - Enabled DaisyUI plugin via `index.css` configuration.
  - Created `Sidebar` and `Layout` components using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI utility classes.
  - Wrapped application routes in `<Layout>` within `App.tsx` to include the new sidebar.
- **Consolidated API Hooks to `apiConfig`:**
  - Deleted redundant API modules (`userApi.ts`, `sessionApi.ts`, `categoryApi.ts`, `ideaApi.ts`).
  - Refactored `useUsers`, `useSessions`, `useCategories`, and `useIdeas` to import `apiConfig` directly.
  - Moved relevant type definitions into their respective hook files.
- **Verification & Next Steps:**
  - Run `pnpm -r lint` to catch any issues.
  - Test UI layout, responsiveness, and DaisyUI theming across pages.
  - Remove `packages/frontend/src/api/types.ts` if it's still present and redundant.

## 2025-01-15: Frontend Structure & Type Refactoring

- Refactored `packages/frontend/src` structure to align with `frontend-structure.md` (moved `constants.ts` to `lib/constants.ts`, organized `components/layout`, relocated `api/` into `services/` and added `services/queries`).
- Completed `apiConfig` in `services/api/config.ts` with fetch, get, post, put, patch, delete and error handling.
- Updated API service files (`userApi.ts`, `sessionApi.ts`, `ideaApi.ts`, `categoryApi.ts`) to use `apiConfig` and return `ApiResponse<T>`.
- Refactored React Query hooks (`useUsers.ts`, `useSessions.ts`, `useIdeas.ts`, `useCategories.ts`) to remove local types, import shared types from `@ai-brainstorm/types`, and use a helper for consistent API responses.
- Cleaned up deprecated files and fixed import paths.
- Ran linter and resolved errors across services and hooks.

## 2023-12-29
