This file tracks the development activities of the AI Brainstorm app in reverse chronological order (newest entries at the top).

## 2023-08-28

**Context Tracking Setup**

  - README.md with project overview
  - MVP-Plan.md with phased approach
  - Architecture.md with system design
  - Features.md with feature specifications
  - API-Design.md with endpoint definitions
  - UI-Design.md with interface guidelines
  - Development-Guide.md with setup instructions
  - ADRs for key technical decisions

**Project Structure**

- Initialized project as monorepo with PNPM workspaces
- Set up basic directory structure following the architecture docs
- Created base configuration files:
  - package.json
  - pnpm-workspace.yaml
  - tsconfig.base.json

## 2023-08-28: Implemented Shared Types Package

- Created the `@ai-brainstorm/types` package with the following features:
  - Zod schemas for core data models: User, Session, Idea, and Category
  - Type definitions derived from Zod schemas
  - Validation utilities for schema validation
  - Helper functions for type checking
- Models implemented:

  - `User`: Basic user profile with authentication information
  - `Session`: Brainstorming session with metadata and relationship to users
  - `Idea`: Individual ideas within a session with position and categorization
  - `Category`: Grouping mechanism for ideas with color coding

- Next steps:
  - Initialize frontend application with Vite, React, and TailwindCSS
  - Initialize backend application with Cloudflare Workers and Hono
  - Implement the database schema with Prisma

## Next Steps

- Set up shared types package
- Initialize frontend application with Vite
- Initialize backend application with Cloudflare Workers
- Implement basic API communication between frontend and backend

## 2024-04-27: Foreign Key Constraint Error on Session Creation

- **Issue:** Encountered a foreign key constraint error when creating a session via the backend API. Error message:
  - `Failed to create session: Foreign key constraint violated`
- **Root Cause:** The hardcoded `ownerId` ("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000") used for development/testing does not exist in the `User` table, violating the foreign key constraint.
- **Solution:** Add a dummy user with the placeholder UUID to the `User` table for development and testing. Ensure all collaborator IDs also exist in the `User` table.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Add a migration or seed script to insert the dummy user if not present.
  - Update documentation to reflect this requirement for local/dev environments.

## 2024-04-29: Backend Integration with Database Package

- Integrated the database package with the backend API:

  - Installed necessary dependencies (@cloudflare/workers-types)
  - Created user routes that utilize the database package
  - Set up project references in TypeScript configuration
  - Ensured backend and database share a single D1 database
  - Fixed module resolution and type issues

- Key implementation details:

  - Repository pattern implemented for database access
  - Consistent error handling across API routes
  - Updated wrangler configuration to use the correct migrations directory
  - TypeScript path aliases to resolve module imports

- Next steps:
  - Install additional dependencies for the backend
  - Complete integration with Zod validation schemas from types package
  - Implement remaining API routes for sessions, ideas, and categories

## 2024-04-29: Database Package Implementation with Prisma and Cloudflare D1

- Created a new `@ai-brainstorm/database` package with the following:

  - Prisma schema with models for User, Session, Idea, and Category
  - D1 adapter integration for Cloudflare Workers
  - SQL migration files for initial schema
  - Seed script with default development user
  - Client utility for accessing the database from Workers

- Key decisions:
  - Used SQLite dialect for D1 compatibility
  - Configured Prisma with driver adapters for D1 integration
  - Set up relations between models to support data integrity
  - Added cascade deletion for session-related data
- Next steps:
  - Integrate database package with backend API
  - Implement data access layer in backend using the Prisma client
  - Set up data validation with schemas from types package

## 2024-04-30: Complete Repository Pattern Implementation

- Implemented repositories for all models:

  - Created SessionRepository with methods for working with brainstorming sessions
  - Created IdeaRepository with special handling for position field (JSON serialization/deserialization)
  - Created CategoryRepository for managing idea categories
  - Updated database exports to include all repositories

- Fixed schema compatibility issues:
  - Changed Idea.position from JSON to String type for SQLite/D1 compatibility
  - Added position parsing/formatting in the IdeaRepository
  - Created migration for schema changes
- Added reference implementation for using repositories in application code
- Next steps:
  - Integrate repositories with backend API endpoints
  - Add validation using schemas from the types package
  - Create API endpoints for all models

## API Implementation Update - 2024-10-07

### Completed Tasks

1. **API Endpoints**: Implemented full CRUD API endpoints for all models:

   - Users - `/api/users`
   - Sessions - `/api/sessions`
   - Ideas - `/api/ideas`
   - Categories - `/api/categories`

2. **Repository Integration**: All API endpoints now use the repository pattern:

   - Consistent error handling
   - Strong typing
   - Clean separation of concerns

3. **Data Validation**: Added robust request validation using Zod schemas:

   - Custom validation helpers in types package
   - Proper error formatting
   - Type safety across the application

4. **Database Migrations**: Set up infrastructure for database migrations:

   - Created migration script for applying Prisma migrations to D1
   - Added deployment script for setting up and migrating the database
   - Configured wrangler.toml for migrations

5. **Unit Tests**: Added initial unit tests:
   - Repository tests with Jest mock extensions
   - API endpoint tests using Vitest

### Architecture Overview

The API now follows a clean layered architecture:

1. **Routes Layer** - Handles HTTP requests, validation, and responses
2. **Repository Layer** - Provides data access with error handling
3. **Database Layer** - Manages database connections and migrations

### Next Steps

1. **Authentication & Authorization** - Implement user authentication flow
2. **Integration Tests** - Add more comprehensive tests
3. **API Documentation** - Create OpenAPI documentation
4. **Frontend Integration** - Connect frontend components to new API endpoints
