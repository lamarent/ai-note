**Context Update & Next Actions**

- Reviewed and updated project context tracking files:
  - `current-focus.md` confirms active work on core features (session/idea management) and CI/CD enhancements
  - `next-steps.md` aligns with immediate and short-term goals: CRUD for sessions/ideas, UI/API, and deployment automation
  - `blockers.md` shows no critical blockers; technical challenges for AI integration and Cloudflare/Prisma noted but not blocking
- Knowledge base and architecture docs reviewed for code patterns and integration points
- Confirmed all context tracking and planning is up to date per general.mdc rule

**Next Actions:**

- Continue core feature development:
  - Implement session and idea CRUD (frontend/backend)
  - Enhance UI for session/idea management
  - Complete API endpoints and validation
- Prepare for AI integration:
  - Design service abstraction for OpenAI API
  - Draft prompt templates and caching/rate limiting strategies
  - Begin implementation of AI routes and backend logic
- Maintain context tracking and update documentation after each major step

**Summary:**

- No critical blockers
- Core feature and AI integration work proceeding as planned
- Context, planning, and knowledge base are current

**Context Tracking Setup**

- Created context tracking system for AI-assisted development
- Set up directory structure for maintaining development context
- Added initial documentation for context tracking usage
- Created templates for various context documents

**Project Documentation**

- Completed initial project documentation:
  - README.md with project overview
  - MVP-Plan.md with phased approach
  - Architecture.md with system design
  - Features.md with feature specifications
  - API-Design.md with endpoint definitions
  - UI-Design.md with interface guidelines
  - Development-Guide.md with setup instructions
  - ADRs for key technical decisions

**Project Structure**

- Initialized project as monorepo with PNPM workspaces
- Set up basic directory structure following the architecture docs
- Created base configuration files:
  - package.json
  - pnpm-workspace.yaml
  - tsconfig.base.json

## 2023-08-28: Implemented Shared Types Package

- Created the `@ai-brainstorm/types` package with the following features:
  - Zod schemas for core data models: User, Session, Idea, and Category
  - Type definitions derived from Zod schemas
  - Validation utilities for schema validation
  - Helper functions for type checking
- Models implemented:

  - `User`: Basic user profile with authentication information
  - `Session`: Brainstorming session with metadata and relationship to users
  - `Idea`: Individual ideas within a session with position and categorization
  - `Category`: Grouping mechanism for ideas with color coding

- Next steps:
  - Initialize frontend application with Vite, React, and TailwindCSS
  - Initialize backend application with Cloudflare Workers and Hono
  - Implement the database schema with Prisma

## Next Steps

- Set up shared types package
- Initialize frontend application with Vite
- Initialize backend application with Cloudflare Workers
- Implement basic API communication between frontend and backend
