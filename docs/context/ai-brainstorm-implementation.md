- Support for different brainstorming techniques (General, SCAMPER, Lateral Thinking, etc.)

### 4. Export and Sharing

- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Export preview

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI (dark theme)
- State Management: React Query for server state, useState for local state
- API Calls: Custom hooks and services

## Key Components

- **HomePage**: Landing page with features overview and recent sessions
- **SessionsListPage**: List all sessions with ability to create new ones
- **SessionDetailPage**: View session details with tabbed interface for ideas, AI generation, and export
- **IdeasList**: Display and manage ideas in a session
- **AIGenerationPanel**: Interface for AI-powered idea generation
- **ExportPanel**: Export session data in different formats

## Next Steps

1. Implement real API integration (currently uses mock data)
2. Add authentication and user management
3. Enhance AI generation with more techniques and features
4. Add collaborative features
5. Improve idea organization with drag-and-drop and visual relationships

## UI Theme

The application uses DaisyUI with the dark theme as default, avoiding custom color classes.
