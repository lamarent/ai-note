# Current Focus

This document describes what's currently being worked on in the AI Brainstorm project.

## Active Development

**Phase 2: Core Features & Deployment**

We have completed Phase 1 (project setup, infrastructure, and CI/CD). The current focus is on core feature development and enhancing deployment workflows.

### Recently Completed

- ✅ Project documentation and context tracking
- ✅ Monorepo setup with pnpm workspaces
- ✅ Shared types package with Zod schemas
- ✅ Frontend and backend initialization
- ✅ Database schema and integration
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions for lint, type-check, test; all packages pass in CI)

### In Progress

- Implement core brainstorming session functionality (CRUD, UI, API)
- Implement basic idea management (add, edit, delete, categorize)
- Enhance CI/CD with deployment workflows (Cloudflare Pages, Workers)

### Up Next

- Add deployment status badge to README
- Document environment variable setup for CI/CD
- Begin AI service integration (OpenAI API, prompt templates)

## Current Sprint Goals

1. Implement core session and idea management features
2. Enhance CI/CD with deployment workflows
3. Prepare for AI service integration

## Technical Focus Areas

- **Frontend**: Session/idea management UI, state management
- **Backend**: API endpoints for sessions/ideas, validation
- **CI/CD**: Deployment automation, environment config
- **AI**: Service abstraction, prompt design (upcoming)
