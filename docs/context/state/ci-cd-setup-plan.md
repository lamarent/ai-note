# CI/CD Setup Plan

This document tracks the plan, context, and actionable steps for setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for the AI Brainstorm project.

---

## Rationale

- Ensure code quality and consistency across the monorepo
- Automate testing, linting, and deployment for faster feedback
- Use pnpm for efficient monorepo management
- Leverage GitHub Actions for integrated, low-maintenance CI/CD
- Support incremental, minimal, and AI-assisted development

## Requirements

- Monorepo support with pnpm workspaces
- Automated install, lint, type-check, and test for all packages
- Deployment workflows for frontend (Cloudflare Pages) and backend (Cloudflare Workers)
- Environment variable management for secrets
- Minimal, incremental setup (start with test/lint, add deploy later)

## Current State

- Monorepo initialized with pnpm workspaces
- No CI/CD workflows configured yet
- Scripts for lint, test, and build exist in package.json
- Deployment scripts exist for manual use

## Plan & Checklist

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for install, lint, type-check, and test (all packages)
- [ ] Use pnpm for all install and script steps
- [ ] Add caching for pnpm store
- [ ] Add status badge to README
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` for frontend deploy (Cloudflare Pages)
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml` for backend deploy (Cloudflare Workers)
- [ ] Document environment variable setup for CI/CD
- [ ] Incrementally improve workflows (e.g., add preview deploys, notifications)

## Next Actions

1. Implement minimal CI workflow for install, lint, type-check, and test
2. Verify workflow runs on PR and push to main
3. Add deployment workflows for frontend and backend
4. Update documentation and troubleshooting as needed
