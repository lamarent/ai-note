# CI/CD Setup Plan

This document tracks the plan, context, and actionable steps for setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for the AI Brainstorm project.

---

## Rationale

- Ensure code quality and consistency across the monorepo
- Automate testing, linting, and deployment for faster feedback
- Use pnpm for efficient monorepo management
- Leverage GitHub Actions for integrated, low-maintenance CI/CD
- Support incremental, minimal, and AI-assisted development

## Requirements

- Monorepo support with pnpm workspaces
- Automated install, lint, type-check, and test for all packages
- Deployment workflows for frontend (Cloudflare Pages) and backend (Cloudflare Workers)
- Environment variable management for secrets
- Minimal, incremental setup (start with test/lint, add deploy later)

## Current State

- Monorepo initialized with pnpm workspaces
- CI/CD workflows for lint, type-check, and test are passing
- Deployment workflows for frontend and backend are implemented
- CI status badge added to README

## Plan & Checklist

- [x] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for install, lint, type-check, and test (all packages)
- [x] Use pnpm for all install and script steps
- [x] Add caching for pnpm store
- [x] Add status badge to README
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` for frontend deploy (Cloudflare Pages)
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml` for backend deploy (Cloudflare Workers)
- [ ] Document environment variable setup for CI/CD
- [ ] Incrementally improve workflows (e.g., add preview deploys, notifications)

## Next Actions

1. Document environment variable setup for CI/CD and deployment workflows
2. Monitor deployments and update troubleshooting docs as needed
3. Continue with core feature and AI integration development
