## Database Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| 2023-08-28 | Use UUID for primary keys | Distribute well in sharded environments | Auto-increment integers | Better for distributed systems |
| 2023-08-28 | Implement soft deletes for ideas | Allow for recovery/undo | Hard deletes | Better user experience |
| 2023-08-28 | Store idea position as integer | Simple reordering | Linked list, float positions | Easy implementation with occasional rebalancing |

## AI Integration Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|--------|

| 2023-08-28 | Deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages | Integration with Cloudflare Workers | Vercel, Netlify | Unified deployment platform |

## Testing Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| 2023-08-28 | Use Jest for unit testing | Well-supported in React ecosystem | Vitest | Familiar API, good documentation |
