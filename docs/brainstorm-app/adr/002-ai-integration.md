# Architecture Decision Record: AI Integration Approach

Accepted

## Context

The brainstorming application requires AI capabilities to help users generate, expand, and organize ideas. We need to determine the most effective way to integrate AI services into our application architecture while considering performance, cost, reliability, and user experience.

## Decision

We will use the **OpenAI API** as our primary AI service provider, with the following implementation approach:

1. **Backend Proxy Architecture** - All AI requests will go through our backend API rather than directly from the client to OpenAI
2. **Prompt Templates** - We will create and maintain a library of optimized prompt templates for different brainstorming methods
3. **Caching Layer** - Implement response caching for common or similar requests to reduce API costs and improve performance
4. **Fallback Mechanisms** - Design the system to gracefully handle AI service outages or rate limiting

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Self-hosted Open Source Models** (like Hugging Face models) - While this would give us more control and potentially lower costs, it requires significant infrastructure and expertise to maintain. The quality of results would likely be lower than OpenAI's offerings.

2. **Direct Client-to-OpenAI Architecture** - This would simplify our backend but would expose API keys to clients and make it harder to implement caching, rate limiting, and usage tracking.

3. **Multiple AI Providers** - While this would provide redundancy, it would increase development complexity and require maintaining multiple integration points.

4. **Custom-trained Model** - Training our own model specifically for brainstorming would be ideal but requires significant data and resources that are beyond our current scope.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Using OpenAI provides access to state-of-the-art language models
- Backend proxy approach gives us control over API usage, costs, and security
- Prompt template library ensures consistent, high-quality AI responses
- Caching reduces costs and improves response times for common requests

### Negative

- Dependency on a third-party service introduces potential reliability concerns
- OpenAI API costs scale with usage and could become significant as the application grows
- Need to regularly update prompt templates as the OpenAI models evolve

### Neutral

- Will need to monitor and adjust the system based on actual usage patterns
- May need to implement client-side optimistic UI updates to maintain responsiveness during AI calls

## Implementation

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. Create backend services to proxy OpenAI API requests
2. Develop and test a library of prompt templates for different brainstorming scenarios
3. Implement caching mechanisms for AI responses
4. Set up monitoring and usage tracking
5. Create fallback content and mechanisms for handling service disruptions

## Notes

As AI technology evolves rapidly, we should review this decision periodically to ensure we're using the most effective tools. We should also consider implementing a more sophisticated AI orchestration layer if usage grows substantially.
