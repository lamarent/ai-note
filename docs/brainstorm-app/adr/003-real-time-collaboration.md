# Architecture Decision Record: Real-time Collaboration Approach

## Date

2024-07-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A key feature of our brainstorming application is real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to work together on brainstorming sessions simultaneously. We need to determine the most effective approach for implementing real-time collaboration that provides a smooth user experience while maintaining data consistency and performance.

## Decision

We will implement real-time collaboration using **WebSockets** with the following architecture:

1. **WebSocket Server** - Implement a dedicated WebSocket server using Socket.IO to handle real-time communication
2. **Event-Based Architecture** - Use an event-based system where all actions are broadcasted as events to connected clients
3. **Operational Transformation (OT)** - Implement a simplified OT algorithm to handle conflict resolution for concurrent edits
4. **Presence Tracking** - Maintain real-time user presence and cursor position information
5. **Optimistic UI Updates** - Apply changes locally before server confirmation for a responsive feel

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Polling** - Regular API polling for updates would be simpler to implement but would create unnecessary server load and wouldn't provide a truly real-time experience.

2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** - While SSE would allow server-to-client updates, the one-way communication model would require a separate mechanism for client-to-server communication, complicating the architecture.

3. **Third-party Collaboration Services** (like Firebase Realtime Database) - These services would simplify implementation but would add an external dependency, potential costs, and less flexibility in our collaboration features.

4. **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)** - CRDTs would provide stronger conflict resolution guarantees but are more complex to implement and may be overkill for our specific collaboration needs.

## Consequences

### Positive

- WebSockets provide true real-time bidirectional communication
- Event-based architecture allows for flexible handling of different collaboration actions
- Operational Transformation resolves conflicts in a predictable manner
- Users will see immediate feedback on their actions with optimistic updates

### Negative

- Need to handle WebSocket connection issues and reconnection logic
- Server must maintain state for all active sessions
- Complexity in correctly implementing conflict resolution
- Increased server resource usage compared to non-real-time alternatives

### Neutral

- Will need to consider scaling the WebSocket server as user base grows
- Need to implement proper authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections

## Implementation

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. Set up Socket.IO server integrated with our backend
2. Define the event protocol for different user actions
3. Implement client-side connection and event handling
4. Develop the conflict resolution system
5. Add presence tracking and cursor position sharing
6. Test with multiple concurrent users to ensure smooth collaboration

- [005-authentication.md] - How users will be authenticated in real-time connections

## Notes

While this approach increases system complexity, real-time collaboration is a core differentiator for our application, justifying the additional effort. We should monitor performance and user experience closely during initial deployment to ensure this approach meets our needs.
