# Architecture Decision Record: Frontend Framework Selection

## Date

2024-07-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AI-powered brainstorming application requires a modern, performant, and maintainable frontend framework. The framework should support rapid development, provide good developer experience, and efficiently handle real-time updates for collaborative brainstorming sessions.

## Decision

We will use **React** as our frontend framework, along with the following core technologies:

- **Vite** for build tooling and development server
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with **DaisyUI** for component primitives
- **Zustand** for state management
- **React Router** for routing

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Vue.js** - While Vue provides excellent reactivity and is easy to learn, React has a larger ecosystem and better support for TypeScript. Our team also has more experience with React.

2. **Angular** - Angular provides a more comprehensive framework but is heavier and has a steeper learning curve. The additional structure isn't necessary for our application size.

3. **Svelte** - Svelte offers great performance and a clean developer experience, but has a smaller ecosystem and fewer resources for complex problems we might encounter.

4. **Next.js** - Considered but decided against as we don't need server-side rendering for this application. The brainstorming app is primarily client-side with API calls to the backend.

## Consequences

### Positive

- React's component-based architecture aligns well with our UI design
- Strong TypeScript integration improves code quality and maintainability
- Vite provides fast development and optimized builds
- Tailwind CSS allows for rapid UI development with consistent design
- Large ecosystem of libraries and community support
- Team's existing experience with React reduces learning curve

### Negative

- React's one-way data flow might require more code for complex state management
- Bundle size needs careful monitoring to maintain performance
- Need to be careful with unnecessary re-renders in collaborative features

### Neutral

- Regular updates to React and its ecosystem require ongoing maintenance
- Will need to establish clear component patterns to maintain consistency

## Implementation

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. Set up a Vite project with React and TypeScript
2. Configure Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
3. Set up the project structure with clear separation of concerns
4. Implement core components following the UI design document
5. Develop state management for local and shared state

## Notes

While this decision establishes React as our frontend framework, we should periodically review newer technologies and practices to ensure we're using the most effective tools for our needs.
