# Development Workflow - AI-Powered Brainstorming App

## Development Approach

This project follows a modern, iterative development approach with these core principles:

1. **Feature-focused** - We develop in small, complete feature increments
2. **Test-driven** - Tests are written before or alongside implementation
3. **User-centered** - Design and development decisions prioritize user experience
4. **AI-enhanced** - We use AI tools to accelerate development where appropriate

## Development Environment

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/brainstorm-app.git
   cd brainstorm-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your specific configuration
   ```

4. Start the development server
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Git Workflow

We follow a feature branch workflow:

1. Create a branch for each feature, bug fix, or task

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/idea-expansion
   ```

2. Make regular, atomic commits with clear messages

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add AI-powered idea expansion capability"
   ```

3. Push your branch and create a pull request

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/idea-expansion
   ```

4. After review and approval, merge to main branch

## Development Cycle

### 1. Planning

1. Select an item from the project board
2. Clarify requirements and acceptance criteria
3. Create a technical design if needed for complex features
4. Break down into smaller tasks

### 2. Implementation

1. Write tests first if following strict TDD
2. Implement the feature in small, testable increments
3. Follow the established code style and patterns
4. Document as you go

### 3. Testing

1. Ensure all unit tests pass
2. Add integration tests for component interactions
3. Manually test the feature in the development environment
4. Address any issues found during testing

### 4. Review

1. Submit a pull request
2. Address feedback from code review
3. Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes
4. Get final approval

### 5. Deployment

1. Merge to main branch after approval
2. Verify deployment in staging environment
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor for any issues post-deployment

## Coding Standards

### General Practices

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow eslint and prettier configurations
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names

### Frontend Standards

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep component files under 300 lines
- Use styled-components or Tailwind for styling
- Place reusable components in the shared components directory
- Implement responsive design for all UI components

### Backend Standards

- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Validate all input with Zod schemas
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Keep controllers thin, with business logic in services

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Each component and service should have unit tests
- Target at least 80% code coverage
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Testing

- Test interactions between components
- Test critical user flows end-to-end
- Verify API integrations work as expected

### AI-Specific Testing

- Test AI integrations with a variety of inputs
- Evaluate AI response quality regularly
- Have fallbacks for when AI services are unavailable

## Documentation

All code should be documented according to these guidelines:

- **Components** - Document props, state, and any complex logic
- **API Endpoints** - Document request/response format and authentication requirements
- **Services** - Document public methods and their usage
- **Utilities** - Document purpose and usage with examples

## Release Process

1. **Planning**: Determine what features will be included in the next release
2. **Feature Freeze**: Stop adding new features and focus on stability
3. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of all features in the release
4. **Documentation**: Update user documentation and release notes
5. **Release**: Deploy to production and announce the release
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor for issues after release
