# AI Development Guidelines

## Core Principles

- Autonomous development: Proceed with implementation without requiring explicit confirmation
- Incremental progress: Focus on small wins and continuous improvement
- Monorepo architecture: Maintain package boundaries and follow structure
- Documentation-first: Create/update documentation before implementing code

## Development Standards

- Use TypeScript throughout the codebase
- Maintain type safety with Zod schemas for validation
- Follow the established project structure
- Add JSDoc comments for all public functions and interfaces
- Ensure accessibility in all UI components
- Implement proper error handling in all API endpoints

## Tooling

- Use PNPM for package management
- Run commands automatically when needed
- Use shared ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Follow the Vite setup for the frontend

## Implementation Process

1. Update context tracking document
2. Create/update technical documentation
3. Make necessary code changes (following the established patterns)
4. Run tests to verify changes
5. Provide summary of completed task
